# neshla
Fork of neshla from http://neshla.sourceforge.net/

From original authors website:

"NESHLA is an assembler for the Nintendo NES which gives the features of high level languages such as C 
without sacrificing any efficiency or speed. 
It structures and simplifies coding the NES, while still using assembly language. 
Compilers are inefficient for low end systems such as the NES. 
Even with optimizers, they would never produce code for fast action games or capable of tapping deep into the NES. 
It's the best of both worlds!"

Source code updated to compile on Linux OS.

# build
To build neshla binary you need scons from https://scons.org/ and gcc multilib installed.
